# Pyython - Test-driven Development

## Overview
Writing tests and testing source code in Python. Various techniques are introduced here such as:
* Functional Testing
* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing, etc.

The goal is to test the following key metrics:
* Functionality
* Reliability
* Usability
* Efficiency
* Maintainability
* Portability

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-matrix_divided.py` are mandatory tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-lazy_matrix_mul.py` are advanced tasks.
