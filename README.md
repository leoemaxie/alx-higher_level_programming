# Alx Higher Level Programming

## Overview
A series of tasks and exercises aimed at understanding Python.

## Structure.
* Hello World: Tasks aimed at having a deep introduction to Python. This is housed in the [0x00-python-hello_world](/0x00-python-hello_world) directory.

* If/else, Loops, Functions: An introduction to Python condituonals, loops and functions. This is housed in the [0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions](/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) directory.

* Import & Modules: A deep dive into importing and using modules to create reusable programs. This is housed in the [0x02-python-import_modules](/0x02-python-import_modules) directory.

* Data Structures - List, Tuples: A series of programs to understand Python's data structures and when to use them. This is housed in the [0x03-python-data_structures](/0x03-python-data_structures) directory.

* More Data Structures - Set, Dictionary: A deeper dive into Python's data structure. This is housed in the [0x04-python-more_data_structures](/0x04-python-more_data_structures) directory.

* Exceptions: A deep dive into handling errors that occurs when executing a python program. This is housed in the [0x05-python-exceptions](/0x05-python-exceptions) directory.
