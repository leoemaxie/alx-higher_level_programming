# Python - Import & Module

## Overview
A deep dive into importing and using modules to create reusable programs, and controlling the execution of imports using:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Do something...
```

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-args.py` are basic tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-easy_print.py` are advanced tasks.
