# Pyython - More Data Structures: Sets, Dictionary

## Overview
A series of programs to understand Python's data structures and when to use them. Operations and methods on Sets and Dictionaries are also covered in this repo as well as advanced operations on Lists and Tuples.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-uniq_add.py` are mandatory tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-square_matrix_map.py` are advanced tasks.
