# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

## Overview
A series of programs to understand Python's data structures and when to use them. Operations and methods on Lists and Tuples are covered in this repo.

As usual, files prefixed in the tens and units e.g `2-args.py` are mandatory tasks while those prefixed in the hundreds e.g `101-easy_print.py` are advanced tasks.
